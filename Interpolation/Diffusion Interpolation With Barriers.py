# Name: DiffusionInterpolationWithBarriers_Example_02.py
# Description: Diffusion Interpolation with Barriers uses a kernel which is 
#              based upon the heat equation and describes the variation in 
#              temperature with time in a homogeneous medium.
# Requirements: Geostatistical Analyst Extension

# Import system modules
